# What-is-the-Median
Displays current median of inputted numbers

Wrote this short program to keep display the median of a series of inputted numbers by the user.

To compile this program in mac terminal use "clang++ -std=c++14 -o Med Median.cpp" 
Then enter "./Med < Name-of-file.txt" or "/.Med" and then enter numbers individually.
